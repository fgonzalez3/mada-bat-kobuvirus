# Madagascar Bat Kobuvirus

This repo contains analyses for the Madagascar bat Kobuvirus paper. This repo is designed to document which samples from fecal metagenomes have detectable Kobuvirus. 

Sub-directories within this repo contain pipeline directions used to determine which samples are positive for Kobuviruses, as well as data used to make each figure. 

Pipeline for Kobuvirus [initial](https://github.com/fgonzalez3/mada-bat-kobuvirus/blob/main/Finding-Initial-Kobuvirus-Positives.md) and more in depth detection found here. 




Within Fig. __ sub-directory, details on how to build a phylogenetic tree are contained. These scripts outline how to build Fig __ and __, as well as amino acid tree Fig. ___ . 

Details on how to build a Bayesian phylogenetic tree using BEAST2 within the subfolder for Fig. ___ or linked here. This analysis was used to estimate time to MRCA for kobuvirus broadly and the newly-defined Madagascar lineage. 

Beyond the details listed above, all scripts to produce each figure should be self-contained and output results to the "final-figures" folder.
