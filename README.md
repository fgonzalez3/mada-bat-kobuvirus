# Madagascar Bat Kobuvirus

This repo contains analyses for the Madagascar bat kobuvirus paper. This repo is designed to document which samples from fecal and urine datasets have detectable kobuvirus in order to build phylogenies on these kobuviruses and to assemble/characterize full/partial genomes. 

Sub-directories within the repo contain data used to make each figure, along with pipeline directions used to determine which samples are positive for pathogen of interest. 

Within Fig. __ sub-directory, details on how to build a phylogenetic tree are contained. These scripts outline how to build Fig __ and __, as well as amino acid tree Fig. ___ . 

Details on how to build a Bayesian phylogenetic tree using BEAST2 within the subfolder for Fig. ___ or linked here. This analysis was used to estimate time to MRCA for kobuvirus broadly and the newly-defined Madagascar lineage. 

Beyond the details listed above, all scripts to produce each figure should be self-contained and output results to the "final-figures" folder.
